The Alien Planit Contributor Code of Conduct
============================================

The Alien Planit developer community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all Alien Planit spaces, including the Alien Planit repository and any mailing lists, chat groups, wikis, and/or other official channels we use to communicate about the project.

Unacceptable Behavior
---------------------
Unacceptable behavior includes:

* Offensive comments related to race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, religion, nationality, or age.
* Holocaust denial, Nazi symbolism, or support for any form of white nationalism
* Deliberate or persistent misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Sexualized language or imagery in Alien Planit spaces
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop
* Threats of violence 
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others or treating the Alien Planit community as a place to process trauma or mental health crises
* Publication of a person's private information (including images, contact information, or non-harassing private communications) without their consent

Additionally, contributors who have violated the codes of conduct of other communities in which they participate (including conferences), or who otherwise engage in unacceptable or harassing behavior outside of Alien Planit spaces, may be barred from the Alien Planit project and its spaces if the Project Lead determines that their behavior poses an ongoing threat to the safety, inclusivity, or reputation of the Alien Planit project.

Reporting
---------
If you are being harassed by an Alien Planit contributor, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Project Lead. In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports may be deleted without response if the appear to be intended to silence legitimate criticism, or to retaliate against people for establishing reasonable boundaries. 

Enforcement
-----------
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

The Project Lead is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

The Project Lead has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
