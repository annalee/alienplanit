Alien Planit Contributor Guidelines
===================================

Welcome to Alien Planit! Our goal is to make fan-run and non-profit conventions easier to organize.

License
-------

All contributions to this project will be released under the MIT license. By submitting a pull request for this project, you agree to license your contribution under the MIT license to this project.

Community Values
----------------

Inclusion, respect, empathy, and collaboration are essential to maintaining a healthy, effective, and sustainable open-source project community. We ask community members to center these values in our interactions with one another, and in situations where we are representing Alien Planit to the larger community.

It would be impossible to list everything people can do to uphold these values. But when in doubt, we encourage you to look to these principles for guidance:

* Assume competence in fellow contributors and application users.
* Assume that other people involved in the project are doing the best they can with the resources and information available to them.
* Listen carefully and actively, and encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
* Ask questions, and seek to understand other people's context before challenging their approach to a problem.
* Document your thought process in commit messages, code comments, and pull requests.

All Alien Planit contributors are expected to abide by [The Alien Planit Code of Conduct](CODEOFCONDUCT.md).

How To Contribute
-----------------

If you're interested in contributing, reach out to the Project Lead (currently Annalee Flower Horne) and they'll help you get started. We accept most code contributions via pull requests; you can fork this repository on GitHub to send us a pull request.
